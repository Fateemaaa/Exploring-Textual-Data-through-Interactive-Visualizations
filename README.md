# Exploring-Textual-Data-through-Interactive-Visualizations
Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Data Explora4on:
• U1lize Python and libraries like NLTK to perform basic Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks such as Named En1ty Recogni1on (NER) on the chosen dataset. While
formal NLP training is not mandatory, students are encouraged to learn and apply
these techniques for deeper insights.

2. Web Integra4on:
• Implement a backend using Flask or Django to seamlessly transfer processed data
from Python to the web interface.

3. Interac4ve Visualiza4ons:
• Develop a web-based interface using D3.js that hosts a minimum of two
visualiza1ons.
• Visualiza4on Variety: Avoid standard charts (e.g., bar charts) and focus on
more sophis1cated visualiza1ons. You can use any visualiza1on already
developed either available on d3 website or elsewhere that contains d3
code. You must transform that visualiza1on to handle your given data as per
your requirements. The visualiza1ons must be fully interac1ve with all basic
interac1vity func1ons implemented (i.e. highligh1ng, selec1on, zooming
etc.)
• Graph/Tree Visualiza4on: One of the visualiza1ons must be based on graphs
or trees.
• Focus+Context Style: Implement the visualiza1ons in the Focus+Context
style for enhanced user understanding and keeping the context in view all
the 1me.

4. Brushing and Linking (Dashboarding):
• Implement brushing and linking func1onali1es between the visualiza1ons to
enhance user interac1on and explora1on.
